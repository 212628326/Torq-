##### Transportation Design System

The Transportation Design System consists of the GET-specific elements built on top of Predix Design Systemâ€™s principles and basics. These elements are standards across GE Transportation and will be contributed back to the Predix Design Framework.

**Components** are designed from Predix Basics and Principles. These components are typically beyond the scope of the general Predix Design System and specific to the transportation industry.

**Templates** are layouts of entire screens or for regions of a screen. Templates focus on the content structure or layout, not the actual content itself.

**Features** are sets of templates, components, and other design pattern, that when thoughtfully combined, provide a mechanism to solve specific problems for a user of an application.

**Product** Spotlight highlights applications solving real world problems with the Predix and Transportation Design Systems, delivering actual value to customers.
