#### Trains
Train icons are used on geographic mapping to show the location and status of a train. There are two groups of trains that are depicted using distinct shape and color: freight trains and passenger trains.

Each type of train has three statuses:

* Default shown in blue or gray
* Medium alert shown in orange
* High alert shown in red

In addition to using color, the train icons have different levels of outlines that help indicate the severity of the alert. Animation supports calling attention to trains that have alerts.

##### Container Stacks
In yards, containers can be placed in stacks. Stacks are usually kept to a maximum of 4 or 6 containers per stack. On dark interfaces, slightly darker rectangles are placed on top of the container to indicate the number of containers in a stack. On light interfaces, slightly lighter rectangles are used.
