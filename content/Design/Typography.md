#### Best Practices

##### Always Use Roboto

Roboto is a significant part of TORQ. It was hand selected out of hundreds of fonts because of its legibility and industrial look and feel.

##### Create Hierarchy

TORQ has recommended font sizes to make it easy for designers and developers to create clean and legible
products that any user can quickly take in. Utilize the size guidelines below and consider how your layout will be consumed.

##### Be Consistent

Your application should have a consistent use of typography. If you set type rules on one page that are different than
our guidelines, the rest of the workflow should follow those same type rules set on the previous page.

##### Using Bold

Although Heebo comes in Extra Bold and Black, TORQ discourages using them on web and ui applications.
